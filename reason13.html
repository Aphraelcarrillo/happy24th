            Dating you feels like a movie.

I know relationships are supposed to have a "honeymoon phase" where things are perfect at the beginning but then it drops into reality, but it doesn't feel like that for me. 
<br>Every day since we've been dating you whether we're separated by oceans or we're both in Knoxville, I've only ever felt my love for you and my connection to you grow. 
<br><br>I am still in awe that I am dating you in the first place!

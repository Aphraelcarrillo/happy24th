            You choose me, even when I'm far away.

I was so afraid to go on my trip to the Philippines. I was constantly afraid that the worst was going to happen because it happened to me before. It felt like trauma, but you were consistently there for me and updating me even if it was the smallest things. You were intentional about staying connected and it really healed a part of me that scared to trust people. Even while we are away from each other now, I already am doing better than in the Philippines. It means the world to me that you continue to stay by my side. Thank you.

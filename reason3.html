            I love how courageous and adventurous you are.

            Sometimes I forget that the Fall semester of 2024 was your first experience in the USA. I always admired how you're always branching out, meeting new people and trying new things. 
            <br> Coming to the USA for the first time to study and having to find your own community and adjusting to the country is hard, but you did it so well and I feel like you're more of a Tennessean than me!
            <br><br> You are just really amazing and you inspire me!

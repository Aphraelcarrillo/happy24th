            But I say it because I truly mean it every time. And it's not my fault!! Filipinos are so chalant and I feel so lucky to have you, so I'm going to express it to you!

(It's also fun! I haven't made a website since my freshman year of college!)

            My inspiration for this whole thing was the realization that I do actually say "I love you" very many times, but I never go quite as much into detail about <i>why</i> I love you, so this is what this is!

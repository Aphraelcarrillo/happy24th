        <p>
            <h3>Happy birthday, my love!!!</h3> You are now 24! What a blessing it is that you are able to celebrate your birthday back home with your friends and family!
            <br> Today is all about you, and I hope you'll have an amazing time celebrating and just enjoying your special day.

            <br><br> I really wish that I could be with you today, but it's okay because it won't be much longer until we're reunited.
            <br> The wait will always be worth it for me because you truly are a light and joy in my life. I feel so blessed to have you, and truly feels like a privilege to be able to call you mine :)
            
            <br><br> I also know that the first hug when I finally see you again will be straight out of a movie ihihi

        </p>

            It feels like we have been dating for longer than only three months, but we've already done so many things together and we have both grown so much in our relationship together. 
            <br>You are truly such a blessing in my life and it makes me excited for our first Halloween together, first Christmas together, first Valentines Day together, and so much more. 
            <br>I really see you as a long-term person in my life, and I hope you feel the same way because I know that what we have is really really special. 
            <br>You also really inspire me every day to become a better boyfriend, son, friend, and man to all the people around me, and every day I am praying for an amazing future with you. 
            <br><br>I love you so much :) 
            <br>Happy Birthday
